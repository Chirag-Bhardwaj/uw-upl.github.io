# Undergraduate Projects Lab Website

[uw-upl.github.io](http://uw-upl.github.io)

This website will eventually exist at [upl.cs.wisc.edu](http://upl.cs.wisc.edu).

Contributions and issue reports are welcomed!

We use Angular to template data found in the `content/` directory.
Since GitHub is hosting this page, we have no access to a back-end.

## To Serve Locally

Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the following terminal command:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port number> # defaults to 8000
```

If you're using Powershell, set the environment variable:

```bash
$env:path="$env:Path;C:\Python27"
 ```
 
Then you can open your web browser to `http://localhost:<port number>` to see
how the site will appear when served from GitHub.





## How to edit the [stylesheets](/styles)

### Sass

Do not edit `style.css` directly -- it is generated by
[sass](http://sass-lang.com/). You can install `sass`
on the command line using `gem`:

```
$ sudo gem install sass
```

Refer to [the official install page](http://sass-lang.com/install)
for more details.

## What to do

`sass/style.scss` is the root stylesheet for the website.
It is (mostly) made up of imports of the other, partial
stylesheets in `sass/`. The rules you're looking for are
probably found in one of these files.

`_variables.scss` is a very useful file -- it defines
basic variables used in many places on the site (such
as the shade of red we use). Look at it before making
any changes.

After you've changed one or more `.scss` files, you can
regenerate the main `style.css` with the following command:

```
$ sass styles/sass/style.scss:styles/style.css
```

You can pass the `--watch` flag to `sass` if you want `sass`
to automatically regenerate `style.css` when you save changes.
