# Undergraduate Projects Lab Website

[uw-upl.github.io](http://uw-upl.github.io)

This website will eventually exist at [upl.cs.wisc.edu](http://upl.cs.wisc.edu).

Contributions and issue reports are welcomed!

We use Angular to template data found in the `content/` directory.
Since GitHub is hosting this page, we have no access to a back-end.

## To Serve Locally

Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the following terminal command:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port number> # defaults to 8000
```

Then you can open your web browser to `http://localhost:<port number>` to see
how the site will appear when served from GitHub.
