  <h1>The Undergraduate Project Lab</h1>

  <p>
    The UPL is a space for students with an interest in computer science to meet 
    each other, work on projects together, and participate in events.

    The UPL tradition has been carried on since the 1980s, under the advisorship 
    of Professor Barton Miller and an unbroken lineage of elected student 
    coordinators. We are always looking for new members with all levels of 
    experience to join us and become the next generation of the UPL.

        Say hi! Meet some people. You don't even need a Discord account at 
        first. This is our pandemic-time equivalent of "being in the room".

  <h3>
    Do I need to be a CS major?
  </h3>
  <p class="answer">
    No! While we're a CS focused organization, you don't need to be a CS major!
  </p>


  <h3>
    Do I need to be an undergraduate student?
  </h3>
  <p class="answer">
    No, you do not. Anyone who is a registered student with the University is
    welcome to use the machines and resources of the lab. We do have a few graduate
    students that frequent the lab as well.
  </p>


  <h3>
    What resources are available through the UPL?
  </h3>
  <div class="answer">
    <ol>
      <li>A lab room in the CS building.</li>
      <li>Server infrastructure for project use.</li>
      <li>Books to check out.</li>
      <li>And of course, each other, to talk to about anything CS (and more!).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Alas, we are strictly unable to physically enter the building or check out 
      books during the pandemic.

  <h3>
    Can we still use the servers remotely?
  </h3>
  <p class="answer">
    Yes! It is possible for us to remotely access our servers. If that interests 
    you, talk to us! Server infrastructure is an ongoing project.
