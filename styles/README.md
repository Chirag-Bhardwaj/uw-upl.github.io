# How to edit these stylesheets

## Sass

Do not edit `style.css` directly -- it is generated by
[sass](http://sass-lang.com/). You can install `sass`
on the command line using `gem`:

```
$ sudo gem install sass
```

Refer to [the official install page](http://sass-lang.com/install)
for more details.

## What to do

`sass/style.scss` is the root stylesheet for the website.
It is (mostly) made up of imports of the other, partial
stylesheets in `sass/`. The rules you're looking for are
probably found in one of these files.

`_variables.scss` is a very useful file -- it defines
basic variables used in many places on the site (such
as the shade of red we use). Look at it before making
any changes.

After you've changed one or more `.scss` files, you can
regenerate the main `style.css` with the following command:

```
$ sass sass/style.scss:style.css
```

You can pass the `--watch` flag to `sass` if you want `sass`
to automatically regenerate `style.css` when you save changes.
